# Summary

Digital connectivity is an essential infrastructure service, as more and more people and machines are connected to the internet. Mobile internet access is one of the cheapest ways to connect wirelessly, and  new technologies (particularly 5G) can offer access speeds which can rival fixed broadband connections. Successive generations of mobile telecommunication technologies (3G-5G) have increased data transmission rates and reduced latency. However, user-generated data traffic has been growing exponentially over the past decade which is concerning for both mobile network operators and policy decision-makers, with future growth forecasts indicating this trend is likely to continue.

The Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model (``cdcam``), is a decision-support model which quantifies the performance of digital infrastructure strategies for mobile digital communications. ``cdcam`` models the performance of 4G and 5G technologies as they roll-out over space and time, given a set of exogenous population and data growth scenarios, and potential deployment strategies.

The simulation approach can be used nationally, or for a specific sub-regional area. The same decision-support modelling approach is taken as in the field of telecommunication regulation, where the Long-Run Incremental Cost is estimated for a representative hypothetical mobile network operator.
